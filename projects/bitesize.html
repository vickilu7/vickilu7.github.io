        BiteSizeQI is a task-oriented web app that can be used by anyone to learn quality improvement skills. It allows workers to fix
        problems in a consistent and accessible manner in order to effectively impact positive change within large organizations.

      <p class='project_header'>Background</p>
      <p class='project_paragraph'>
        Quality improvement (QI) consists of systematic and continuous actions that lead to
        measurable improvement and is an integral component to delivering high-quality healthcare.
        However, QI is challenging, and with mounting day-to-day duties, healthcare workers struggle
        to find the time to learn proper skills to successfully affect change in their workplace.
      </p>
        <p class='project_paragraph'>
          Duke Cancer Institute works closely with Duke University hospital system in both research as well as project initiatives.
          BiteSizeQI was created to teach and foster micro-innovation within large organizations, such as Duke hospital, which promotes small and
          positive changes. The best ideas don’t always come from the top and, when given the right tools,
          all staff can drive meaningful change. I worked as a UI/UX designer with a team of quality improvement experts, clinicians, programmers
          and researchers at Duke Cancer Institute to create BiteSize QI.
        </p>

        <p class='project_header'>The Challenge</p>
        <p class='project_paragraph'>
          Hierarchies in large organizations dissuade micro innovation due to all the hoops you have to jump through to get your ideas heard.
          In addition people just don’t have the time to learn all the information for quality improvement. Through a simple application,
          we want to level the playing field and allow anyone with an idea impact positive change on their workspace.
        </p>

        <p class='project_header'>My Role</p>
        <p class='project_paragraph'>
          Evaluate the specific needs of various users, redesign the information architecture, convey key ideas in initial mockups,
          execute high-fidelity designs, and ultimately design a functional experience. These are the two main goals we established before
          diving in:<br/><br/>
          1. <strong>Navigation</strong>: Create a seamless navigation system that eliminates unneccessary steps while highlighting essential features that improve the app experience
          <br/><br/>2. <strong>Experience</strong>: Create an intuitive web experience that is supported by effortless, smooth interactions
        </p>

        <p class='project_header'>Our Solution</p>
        <p class='project_paragraph'>
          The original prototype was literally just a series of videos (like one of those required training videos) to watch and then a blueprint form
          to fill out afterwards. We reformatted this information architecture to a dashboard concept that walks the users through step-by-step in order to minimize attention
          as well as information loss. In order to move onto the next video and lesson, you need to complete the activity, which also self populates the blueprint.
        </p>
        <img src='IA.png'/>
        <p class='project_paragraph'>
          Our design was centered around a comment by one of the team members. We got rid of the initial idea of
          having gradient background in favor of the idea that it should be neutral and clean with pops of color to keep users attention on their task.
          <br/><br/><em>“We really want it to have a professional/corporate approach while integrating the colorful and cartoonish nature of the videos.”</em><br/><br/>
        </p>
        <img style = 'width: 50%;'src='gradient.png'/>
        <img style = 'width: 50%;'src='color.png'/>


        <p class='project_paragraph'>
          We also noticed the excessive use of modal windows in the original prototype and felt it was inconvenient for users to constantly open and
          exit out of them. We created a toggle function on the activity screens to show example inputs for the users to get an idea of what they
          should be writing.
        </p>

        <p class='project_header'>How it Works</p>
        <p class='project_paragraph'>
          BiteSize QI is a task-oriented web-based application that helps users identify a problem or deficiency in their workplace, and then walks the user through the fundamentals of quality improvement to help fix the problem.
          Upon logging in, users will work their way through a series of short videos that build their quality improvement skills.
          Concepts include how to create problem statements, effective timelines, and clear solutions.
        </p>
        <p class='project_paragraph'>
          After completing a video, the system then engages the user to apply the skills they have learned by completing simple quality improvement activities.
          As a user completes each activity, the system records the progress made on the dashboard and builds a guide for implementing a solution to the problem using the responses from the activities.
          We call this guide a Project Blueprint.
        </p>
        <p class='project_paragraph'>
          BiteSizeQI enables all members of a team to highlight problems in their workplace and propose fixes for them in
          a structured way consistent with quality improvement principles.

        <p class='project_header'>Outcomes & Impact</p>
        <p class='project_paragraph'>
          BiteSizeQI is currently being used as the primary mode of quality improvement at Duke University Hospital, which is home to over 300 physicians and researchers.
          It is also being implemented in several neighboring healthcare systems as well as local businesses. We've received positive feedback
          regarding the ease and intuitive nature of the web-app from several users and are currently working on another app with Duke Cancer
          Institute (look out for a new project coming soon)!
